# pipewire-avb

## History

In the spring of 2022, the AVB component of PipeWire, was originally introduced
by Wim Taymans who laid out the structure and the strong fondation to get AVB
to work with the minimal. As part of PipeWire framework, it is now its own
module known as _pipewire-avb_ 

As the basis of work was implemented, 
[Simon Gapp](mailto:simon.gapp@kebag-logic.com) and
[Alexandre Malki](mailto:alexandre.malki@kebag-logic.com) under to monicker of
[simongapp](https://github.com/simongapp)
[hakerman-lk](https://github.com/Mister-M-alt), continued the work as a side
project to bring more than AVB: Milan. Bringing Milan in the hands of everyone,
is the top number one priority.
