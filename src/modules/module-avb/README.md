# pipewire-avb-milan

## History

In the spring of 2022, the AVB component of PipeWire was originally
introduced by Wim Taymans, who laid out the structure and a strong
foundation to get AVB working with a minimal implementation.
As part of the PipeWire framework, it is now its own module
known as _pipewire-avb_.

Building on that foundation,
[Simon Gapp](mailto:simon.gapp@kebag-logic.com) and
[Alexandre Malki](mailto:alexandre.malki@kebag-logic.com), under the
monikers [simongapp](https://github.com/simongapp) and
[hakerman-kl](https://github.com/Mister-M-alt), continued the work
as a side  project to bring not just AVB, but Milan. Making Milan
accessible to everyone is the goal of this project.

## Installation Guide

The current implementation is in a very early experimental state, allowing
exploration of basic functionality.

Installation instructions are available here:

We welcome contributions and collaboration from the community to help move
